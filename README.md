## Description ##
Straight-forward C# code that converts a .mdl from the Endless Ocean serie into multiple .obj. Each .obj equals to a mesh.
No known bugs.

## How to run ##
Download the executable, drag and drop the .mdl onto the .exe. It supports multiple .mdl as the input argument, don't abuse it tho, it will make it mad.

## TO DO: ##
- Add an actual command-line interaction. User could choose optional output folder.
	- Could be a cool idea to print on the console at which mesh the script is currently at, instead of the data being logged.
- Optimize some stuff.
